# 🧠 Timpi Nodes – Collector Installers for Linux & Windows

Welcome to the official repository for **Timpi Collector installations**.  
Here you'll find everything you need to run your Timpi Collector node on **Linux** or **Windows**, including easy one-command setup scripts.

## ⚠️ Important Support Notice

Timpi Collectors are supported on the following environments:

* ✅ **Linux Ubuntu 22.04.4+ (native)**
* ✅ **Linux Ubuntu 22.04.4+ with Docker**
* ✅ **Windows 10/11 (native installer)**

❌ **Not Supported**: macOS, WSL (Linux on Windows), Proxmox LXC, or other non-Ubuntu Linux distributions.

👉 If you choose to run on **any other Linux distribution**, you are welcome to try — but we **do not provide technical support in tickets** for non-Ubuntu setups. You must be able to troubleshoot and guide yourself.

👉 Timpi support is limited to the **Collector software** and the **official installation guides**. Network, firewall, and hardware configuration remain the responsibility of the operator.

## 🔄 Timpi Collector Overview

Collectors are decentralized “workers” that crawl the web and gather metadata about websites and pages.  
They do not expose any services to the internet, helping maintain high security and privacy.
