## 🔄 Timpi Collector Overview

Collectors are decentralized “workers” that crawl the web and gather metadata about websites and pages.  
They do not expose any services to the internet, helping maintain high security and privacy.

## 🐳 Docker-Based Collectors

Timpi also supports Docker for advanced users who want an isolated container setup.
Docker setups are ideal for multi-node environments or headless installations.
