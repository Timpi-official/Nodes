# ☁️ **Flux Deployment**

Deploy your Timpi nodes on **FluxCloud** and **FluxEdge** in just a few clicks.
Flux provides decentralized, GPU-accelerated, globally distributed infrastructure — perfect for running Timpi nodes reliably at scale.

Timpi currently supports the following node types on Flux:

* 🔄 **Collectors**
* 🌍 **Geo-Core nodes** *(Coming soon)*
* 🧬 **Synaptron nodes** *(Coming soon)*

Each node has its own dedicated deployment guide with screenshots and step-by-step instructions.

## 🔄 **Collector**

Collectors are decentralized "workers" that crawl the web and extract structured metadata.
They run invisibly behind Timpi’s front-end systems, protecting user privacy and keeping operations secure.

## 🌍 **Geo-Core Node** *(Coming SOON)*

Geo-Core nodes are globally distributed and ensure fast, location-aware routing for Timpi’s AI search.
They strengthen network security and improve global query performance.

## 🧬 **Synaptron Node**

Synaptron nodes form the backbone of Timpi’s AI architecture.
They enable high-speed knowledge exchange, support model inference, and power intelligent data processing.
