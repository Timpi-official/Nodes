## 🛡️ What Is a Guardian?

Guardians are distributed storage nodes that archive web data collected by Timpi Collectors.  
They ensure **data privacy**, **durability**, and **availability**, even across restarts or updates — **no static IP is required**, **port forwarding is required** for TAP communication.
