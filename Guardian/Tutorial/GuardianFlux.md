## Step 2: Add Timpi Collector Nodes (Same Machine)
As you are already paying for the whole machine that your synaptron node is running one, it makes sense
to use the unused resources of that machine to deploy further Timpi Collector Nodes on top of it. You can
redo the below process and deploy multiple Collector Nodes alongside your Synaptron Node on the same
machine,

1. On the machine overview, click the three dots on the machine row, where you have your Synaptron
Node already running, then click + New Deployment,

2. Click on Explore All Templates at the Quick launch section, and search for Timpi Collector, and click on
it.

3. , Read the README if you want to learn more about how the application works. Continue the deployment
process by clicking on the Builder tab or Continue button to configure your application specifications,

4. Adjust resources, or keep them at recommended values, and click on the Deploy App button.

5. You will get forwarded to the Deployment Overview of your application. Wait until your application has
the status running, and click the app URL link.

6. In the newly opened tab, click the Settings icon. Then enter your Timpi Wallet address (must hold a
Timpi NFT), and set the Number of Workers from to , and save it by clicking the Save button.
