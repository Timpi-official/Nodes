1. Type the command in **any channel** (you must have the **Verified Human** role).
2. A **popup window** appears where you enter your **GUID** (and Port if required).
3. Press **Submit** → you get a **private result** (ephemeral message).

   * Other users **cannot see** your GUID or your status.

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Where should I type these commands?**

➡️ In the **Timpi Discord server**. You can type them in **any channel** as long as you have the **Verified Human** role.

**Q: Will other people see my GUID or my results?**

➡️ No. The checkers use **ephemeral responses** → only **you** see the results, nobody else.

**Q: Do I have to paste my GUID into the chat?**

➡️ No. When you type the command, a **popup window** appears. You enter your GUID **privately** in the popup — it never shows in the chat.
