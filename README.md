## 🗂 Node Types

1. 🔄 [Collector](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/tree/main/Collector)  
   Our Collectors are decentralized “workers” crawling the web collecting information about websites and their pages. This system remains invisible from front-end services, safeguarding the security of our Collectors.

2. 🛡️ [Guardian](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/tree/main/Guardian)  
   Guardians are distributed storage nodes that archive the web, safeguarding data collected by Collectors. Guardians ensure data privacy and security without needing a static IP address or open ports.

3. 🧬 [Synaptron](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/tree/main/Synaptron)  
   At the forefront of AI advancement is the Synaptron node. This revolutionary architecture facilitates rapid information exchange, enabling AI models to learn, adapt, and generate responses with remarkable agility.
