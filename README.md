# 🧠 Timpi Nodes – All Node Types & Installers

![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Timpi-official/Nodes)

Welcome to the official repository for **Timpi Node installations**.  
Here you'll find everything you need to run Timpi’s decentralized infrastructure – from lightweight collectors to powerful AI-powered Synaptrons.

We provide:
- ✅ Easy-to-follow installation scripts  
- 🛠️ Regular updates for all node types  
- 📁 Organized directories by node function

## 📝 [Node Registration Guide](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/blob/main/Registration/RegisterNodes.md)

Before you can run a Timpi node (except Collectors), you must **register your Node Access NFT** and receive your unique `GUID`.  
This applies to:
- Synaptron
- Guardian
- Collector
- Geocore

👉 See the [Registration Guide](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/blob/main/Registration/RegisterNodes.md) for full instructions and screenshots.

## 🔍 [Node Checker Guide](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/blob/main/NodeCheckers/NodeCheckers.md)

Want to quickly verify if your **Synaptron, Guardian, or GeoCore** node is online?
We provide official **Discord Slash Commands** (`/synaptronchecker`, `/guardianchecker`, `/geocore`) that let you check your node status privately.

👉 See the [Node Checker Guide](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/blob/main/NodeCheckers/NodeCheckers.md) for usage instructions, screenshots, and example outputs.

## 🗂 Node Types

1. 🔄 [Collector](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/tree/main/Collector)  
   Our Collectors are decentralized “workers” crawling the web collecting information about websites and their pages. This system remains invisible from front-end services, safeguarding the security of our Collectors.

2. 🛡️ [Guardian](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/tree/main/Guardian)  
   Guardians are distributed storage nodes that archive the web, safeguarding data collected by Collectors. Guardians ensure data privacy and security without needing a static IP address or open ports.

3. 🧬 [Synaptron](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/tree/main/Synaptron)  
   At the forefront of AI advancement is the Synaptron node. This revolutionary architecture facilitates rapid information exchange, enabling AI models to learn, adapt, and generate responses with remarkable agility.

4. 🌍 [Geo-Core](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/blob/main/Geocore/README.md)
Geo-Core Nodes are strategically located worldwide, enhancing security and enabling fast, location-aware routing for accurate and efficient data queries. They serve as a backbone for global indexing and intelligent query distribution.

5. ☁️ [Flux Deployment](https://github.com/Timpi-official/Nodes/blob/main/FluxDeployment/README.md)
   Use **FluxCloud** and **FluxEdge** to deploy Collector or Synaptron nodes in just a few clicks.
