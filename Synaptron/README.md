## ⚠️ Important Support Notice

Timpi Synaptrons are supported on the following environments:

* ✅ **Linux Ubuntu 22.04.4+ with Docker** (requires NVIDIA GPU + CUDA drivers)
* ✅ **Windows 10/11 (native installer)**

❌ **Not Supported**: macOS, WSL (Linux on Windows), Proxmox LXC, or other non-Ubuntu Linux distributions.

❌ **Not Supported**: Systems without a supported NVIDIA GPU (CUDA-capable).

👉 If you choose to run on **any other Linux distribution**, you are welcome to try — but we **do not provide technical support in tickets** for non-Ubuntu setups. You must be able to troubleshoot and guide yourself.

👉 Timpi support is limited to the **Synaptron software**, GPU setup instructions, and the **official installation guides**. Network, firewall, and host-system configuration remain the operator’s responsibility.

### 🔎 Check Your GPU First!

Before installing, confirm that your NVIDIA GPU supports CUDA:

If your GPU is **not listed**, you cannot run a Synaptron node.
