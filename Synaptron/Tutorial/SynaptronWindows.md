‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Synaptron Version Display

üõ†Ô∏è Heads up: Even if your Synaptron window shows version 1_1_30, your node might still be running the correct version (e.g. 1_1_34).

This is a known issue ‚Äî the version number displayed at the top of the Synaptron window hasn‚Äôt been updated yet.
‚úÖ To check your real running version, use the /synaptronchecker command in Discord with your GUID, like this:

`
/synaptronchecker guid_last12: jdu76hgb4g3k`
