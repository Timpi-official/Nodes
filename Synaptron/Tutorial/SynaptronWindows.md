## ⚠️ Important Note About Synaptron Version Display

🛠️ **Heads up:** Even if your Synaptron window shows version `1_1_30`, your node **might still be running the correct version** (e.g. `1_1_34`).

This is a known issue — the version number displayed at the top of the Synaptron window hasn’t been updated yet.

✅ To check your actual running version, use the `/synaptronchecker` command in Discord with your GUID, like this:

/synaptronchecker guid_last12: jdu76hgb4g3k

## 🔄 📥 How to Update Synaptron on Windows

If you are running an older version and need to update, you must perform a clean reinstall:

## 🔁 Update Steps:
	1.	Remove the previous version:
	•	Open Add or Remove Programs in Windows.
	•	Search for Synaptron.
	•	Click Uninstall and follow the steps to remove it completely.
	2.	Download the new installer
	3.	Extract it using WinRAR if it’s compressed.
	4.	Install the new version by double-clicking the .exe installer.

🧠 Note: Your node’s GUID stays the same — there’s no need to generate a new on.
